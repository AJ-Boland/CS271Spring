COMP ARCHITECTURE/ASSEMB LANG. Learning how this works on a deeper level

five topics related to computing (maybe an interesting looking data structure?!) that interest you, maybe even include a link to a page talking about the topic both in this README file and on the discord channel for this class:
1. I am interested in the application of this class beyond an understanding of what is happening on a deeper level. I think that as AI's get better and better and coding languages evolve we get constantly farther from the assembly language.
2. I am interested in the unqiue representation of proccess we are sure to see when looking so closely at how data is proccessed and the perspective that will be provided to projects I work on in the future.
3. I want to see how advanced the simulated computer is the we plan to program, the thought of it gets me excited to code!
4. The procces of hacking a simulated computer will help we understand how others can make use of my system, and maybe be able to answer the questions people ask me about hacking everytime I tell them I am majoring in computer science. 
5. Simulating Natural Selection, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZGbIKd0XrM. This is one of the coolest things ever to me, and a couple other things he does with these simulations. I would LOVE to be able to do these simulations.


1. One of the most difficult things for me, whether it is a project I know how to do or have zero clue is where to begin. I want to solder a couple things together at home, old bluetooth headphones and some crappy speakers for a fun music setup in my room, but I've never soldered before so I just avoid stepping in the deep end and hope it comes to me. This can happen with coding projects too and it is a problem I gotta deal with.
2. Data sorting confuses me, I have seen dozens of videos on them and dealt with it but unless I program an animation of the data being moved around it can be hard to comprehend where and what it happening to my data. The algorithims make sense, I just have an issue with not seeing it.
3. Talking with other coders is difficult, it is fun for me until the use of an acronym I am unfamilair with or I am not 100% familair with the topic. I strive to be more knowledgable because of it, but I also reach out less because I don't like be the slacker in the conversation.
4. An obession with efficency, useful for big projects, less useful if it bogs me down. Sometimes even if isn't the best method, in a small project it can be worth it to just go with soemthing that works and get critiqued on it later. I don't like being critiqued but it is better than turning in nothing. 
5. Making coding fun; it is not the end of the world when I am bored mindless typing out a 200 line program, but I can get really into a project when working with others or trying to solve a problem and I know it is just out of reach at the moment. I like it when code has me on the edge of my seat, but I can get pulled out of the mindset by distractions such as a discord message, my dog giving puppy eyes, or just something comes up. Getting and staying in the 'zone' is a struggle sometimes.
